<p>Sorts movie folders by renaming them with a zero padded inverse IMDB rating. Makes it easier to decide what to watch when you have tens / hundreds / thousands of movies in a collection.</p>

<h2>
<a name="why-should-i-use-this" class="anchor" href="#why-should-i-use-this"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why should I use this?</h2>

<p>If you have a collection full of movies, it can be pretty hard to decide which movie to watch. Specially since the movie name is all that helps to decide which to watch.</p>

<p>However, movies are often ranked at IMDB and other sites such as Rotten Tomatoes based on viewer rankings and critic rankings. These can be helpful when you want to make a decision if a movie is worth watching.</p>

<p>For an example, you have the following movie folders inside your Movies folder.</p>

<ul>
<li>Titanic (1997)</li>
<li>The Matrix (1999)</li>
<li>The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001)</li>
</ul><p>Assuming you haven't watched any of these earlier (which is highly unlikely) the only way to decide the order of watching these is by individually looking up the ratings online.</p>

<p>Once you use the movie-ranker on the folder, your folders would look like this (after you sort folders by name).</p>

<ul>
<li>012_The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001)</li>
<li>013_The Matrix (1999)</li>
<li>024_Titanic (1997)</li>
</ul><p>The lower the number, the better the movie (according to ratings). So you can immediately start watching from the first one instead of looking up ratings for each one.</p>

<h2>
<a name="usage" class="anchor" href="#usage"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Usage</h2>

<p>Download and copy <code>rank.py</code> into the directory where all the folders containing movies is located.</p>

<p><strong>Ranking</strong></p>

<p>Once you have the <code>rank.py</code> inside the folder, goto shell/terminal and then navigate to the same.</p>

<p>Type the command <code>python rank.py</code> and press return.</p>

<p><strong>Clearing the Ranking</strong></p>

<p>As earlier, make sure the file <code>rank.py</code> is in the folder where the renamed folders are contained.</p>

<p>Navigate to the folder using the terminal and then type and execute the command <code>python rank.py --clear</code></p>

<h2>
<a name="how-does-this-work" class="anchor" href="#how-does-this-work"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How does this work?</h2>

<p><strong>Ranking</strong></p>

<p>When you ask to rank the folders inside a file, the script makes a request to IMDB ratings API through <a href="http://mymovieapi.com/">http://mymovieapi.com/</a> with the folder name (assuming it's the name of a movie). </p>

<p><em>eg: Titanic (1997)</em>
IMDB rating : 7.6</p>

<p>It will look at the ranking provided by IMDB, multiplies it by 10 to remove the decimals and then substracts it from 10. Then it will add a zero padding (eg: 007 for 7) to make sure the folders are sorted in the folder explorers.</p>

<p>10 - 7.6 = 2.4</p>

<p>2.4 * 10 = 24</p>

<p>Assuming there are 100 movie folders in the current folder, it will add a zero padding (and an underscore at the end).</p>

<p>24 becomes 024</p>

<p>The movies folder Titanic (1997) gets renamed to 024_Titanic (1997)</p>

<p>Since Titanic is a better movie than another movie (according to IMDB rankings) that has a lesser rank, you can choose which movie to watch just by looking at the folder name! Isn't that cool?</p>

<p>Finally your movies folder containing Titanic (1997) and Matrix (1999) would look like this when you sort folder by name in your folder explorer.</p>

<ul>
<li>013_Matrix (1999)</li>
<li>024_Titanic (1997)</li>
</ul><p>So you can start immediately watching Matrix (1999) without having to toss a coin to decide which to watch. (Sorry, Titanic).</p>

<p><strong>Clearing the Ranking</strong></p>

<p>Ranking can get pretty addictive, and once you have ranked all your folders, sometimes you might need to revert back to the original folder names.</p>

<p>When you clear the ranks, it will change the folder names back to the original as they were. Pretty neatly.</p>
